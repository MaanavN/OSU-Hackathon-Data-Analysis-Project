**Challenge 2: Food For Thought**

*The Food Systems Analytics Challenge*

**Introduction**

Dive into the heart of High School I/O's Data Visualization Challenge, a unique blend of data analysis and design. This is where analytical minds meet design sensibilities to extract meaningful insights from datasets. This is the platform for aspiring data scientists and budding designers to shine and demonstrate the interplay between fast food menu offerings and how they impact consumers

***Learning Outcomes:***

* **Data Interpretation and Analysis Skills:** Participants will develop the ability to interpret complex datasets and identify patterns and correlations.  
* **Data Visualization and Storytelling:** Through creating dashboards and visualizations, participants will enhance their skills in presenting data in a clear and compelling way.

**Challenge Overview**

Using the provided data set, participants are called to develop insightful visualizations that explore patterns in fast food menus. The dataset includes many food items across multiple fast-food chains, as well as their detailed nutritional breakdowns (such as calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, sugars, sodium, etc.).

Your goal is to analyze, compare, and communicate health-related insights that could influence consumer decisions, highlight food equity concerns, or encourage healthier alternatives. You may also explore how certain foods might contribute differently to nutrition, accessibility, cost, or health outcomes.

***Potential Themes or Focus Areas:***

	You are not limited at all to these\! They are just ideas to spark your thinking.

| Focus Area | Guiding Questions |
| :---: | ----- |
| Health Impact | Which menu items are highest in calories, fat, sodium, or sugar? Are there “surprisingly unhealthy” items? What foods are actually nutritious? |
| Chain Comparison | How do major fast-food restaurants differ nutritionally? Which chain offers the healthiest vs. least healthy options? |
| Food Accessibility & Equity | Are lower-cost menu items significantly less healthy? How might this impact communities with limited food access? |
| Consumer Recommendations | Based on your analysis, what guidelines would you suggest for better eating decisions at fast food restaurants? |

***Challenge Rules:***

1. **Data Interpretation:** Understand and correctly interpret the dataset. General cleaning has been done, but further processing or feature engineering is encouraged to strengthen insights.  
2. **Visualization Tools:** You may use any data visualization platform, including Tableau, Power BI, Python, R, D3.js, Excel, etc.  
3. **Multiple Dashboards or Visuals:** You must create at least two visualizations with clear insights (e.g., comparing two food chains OR analyzing the top 10 healthiest vs. unhealthiest items). More depth \= stronger submission.  
4. **Narrative & Insight:** Don’t just show data: your project must share a story. Highlight why trends exist and what they mean for health, food equity, or consumer awareness. Insightful storytelling is strongly encouraged.  
5. **AI Usage:** You may use any AI tools, but we strongly encourage using Lovable\! At the same time, using AI is optional: creativity and clarity matter more.
